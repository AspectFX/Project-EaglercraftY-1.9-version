## Compiling

To compile for the web, run the gradle 'teavm' compile target to generate the classes.js file.

To complile to regular desktop Java for quick debugging, using native OpenGL for rendering instead of WebGL:
- Create a new empty eclipse project
- Link the src/main/java and src/lwjgl/java as source folders and add the jars in lwjgl-rundir as dependencies
- Create a run configuration and add a jvm argument pointing to the lwjgl natives folder (lwjgl-rundir/natives) like this: `-Djava.library.path=natives`, and make sure the working directory for the run configuration is the lwjgl-rundir folder.


To modify the game's resource pack (javascript/assets.epk), view the readme in the [/epkcompiler](https://github.com/LAX1DUDE/eaglercraft/tree/main/epkcompiler) directory

this project is just a proof of concept to show what can be accomplished when using TeaVM to cross compile an existing java program to javascript. It is not very fast or stable, and the only real useful portion is the emulator code which creates a makeshift fixed function OpenGL 1.3 context using webgl (based on OpenGL 3.3) operational in the browser. Maybe it can be used to port other games in the future.
